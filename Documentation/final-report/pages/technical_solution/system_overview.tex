\subsubsection{Frontend Technologies}

The frontend stack plays a critical role in providing a smooth and interactive user experience for the application. It is built on top of modern web technologies, each serving a unique purpose:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{} \textbf{Next.js:} This React framework offers server{-}side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), which improve performance, SEO, and user experience.
    \item{} \textbf{React:} As the foundation of the frontend, React allows for component{-}based development, making the interface scalable and easy to maintain.
    \item{} \textbf{TailwindCSS:} A utility{-}first CSS framework that simplifies styling by providing ready{-}to{-}use classes, enabling rapid UI development.
    \item{} \textbf{shadcn/ui:} A collection of reusable UI components that work seamlessly with Next.js and React, enhancing productivity and consistency across the application.
    \item{} \textbf{Mapbox:} A powerful mapping platform that enables interactive, customizable maps. It helps visualize geospatial data effectively, which is key for location{-}based services in this project.
\end{itemize}

These technologies combine to create an engaging user interface that is both functional and visually appealing, allowing users to interact with location{-}based data and services efficiently.

\subsubsection{Machine Learning Technologies}

The machine learning stack adds intelligent capabilities to the system, enabling advanced features such as object detection and data annotation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the tools in this section:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{} \textbf{Ultralytics YOLO:} A real{-}time object detection model that helps identify specific objects in images or maps, enhancing the system's ability to recognize and interpret visual data.
    \item{} \textbf{Label Studio:} A flexible tool for annotating datasets, enabling easy labeling of images, text, and audio. This is crucial for creating high{-}quality datasets to train machine learning models like YOLO\@.
    \item{} \textbf{Python:} The primary language for developing and running machine learning models, Python supports data processing, model training, and analysis.
    \item{} \textbf{Jupyter Notebooks:} An interactive platform that allows data scientists to experiment with code, visualize results, and document their machine learning processes.
\end{itemize}

These technologies allow the application to process and analyze data intelligently, enabling features such as object recognition in geographical data and personalized insights.

\subsubsection{Backend Technologies}

The backend stack ensures the application can handle large volumes of data, manage user requests, and perform complex computations. Some of the key technologies include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{} \textbf{Go (Golang):} A highly performant programming language ideal for building scalable backend services.
    \item{} \textbf{PostGIS:}  An extension of \textbf{PostgreSQL}, PostGIS adds geographic object support to the database, making it easier to work with spatial data like maps, coordinates, and distance calculations.
    \item{} \textbf{sqlc:} A SQL code generator that helps developers write type{-}safe database queries in Go, reducing the chances of errors during database interactions.
    \item{} \textbf{JWT:} A compact, URL{-}safe token format used for securely transmitting information between parties, often for authentication and authorization purposes.
\end{itemize}

By leveraging these tools, the backend is capable of managing complex spatial data, performing queries on geospatial data, and ensuring smooth user interactions through highly responsive APIs.
