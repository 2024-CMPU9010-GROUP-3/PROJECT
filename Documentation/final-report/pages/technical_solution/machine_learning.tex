\subsubsection{Data collection process}
Satellite images collected using Mapbox (Mapbox Streets and Mapbox Satelite)


\subsubsection{Yolo model used for car detection}


\subsubsection{Parking spot detection}
To identify the parking spots from the cars detected by the Yolo model, the cars are classified into on the road or parked, based on a road mask.

\subsubsection{Road mask generation}
Different iterations of the road mask were used, the main iterations and their differences are listed below.
The original mask was a very simple binary mask which identified the road pixels by their color, as the majority of roads are depicted in white.
Then through testing and analysing the Mapbox street view, we discovered certain motorways or national roads were shown in yellow or orange, so 2 additional color masks were concatenated to the original binary wise through bitwise operations.

Removing street names through morphological operations, different kernels and parameters tested, different contours.

Then Canny edge, but results were terrible.

Then finally added larger roads for highways.
