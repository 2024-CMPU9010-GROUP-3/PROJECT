\subsubsection{Frontend Architecture and Implementation}
The frontend of the Magpie project is central to delivering a seamless, responsive, and user-friendly interface for urban planners and casual users. With a focus on providing aggregated data on public amenities, the frontend not only caters to analytical needs but also ensures inclusivity, accessibility, and scalability. This section delves into the technologies, architectural decisions, and user-centric features that make Magpie’s frontend robust and future-ready.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Core Technologies and Frameworks:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{React and Next.js:} \\
        The combination of React and Next.js is pivotal to the frontend's architecture. React's component-driven approach enables reusable, modular UI elements, fostering rapid development. Next.js enhances this with features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), which significantly improve page load times and SEO.\\

        \textbf{Key benefits: }
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Component Reusability:} Components such as data visualization widgets, navigation bars, and filter panels can be reused across multiple pages.
            \item \textbf{SEO Optimization:} With SSR, content is preloaded on the server, making the application more search-engine-friendly.
            \item \textbf{Routing:} Next.js simplifies dynamic and nested routing, accommodating the needs of a complex application.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{TailwindCSS}
        A utility-first CSS framework, TailwindCSS, provides a consistent design language across the application. Its predefined utility classes simplify styling while allowing for quick prototyping. 
        \textbf{Enhancements with TailwindCSS:: }
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Rapid Development:}  Predefined classes reduce the need for custom CSS.
            \item \textbf{Customization:}  The framework supports themes and dark/light modes, catering to diverse user preferences.
            \item \textbf{Animation:}  TailwindCSS-animate introduces subtle, engaging animations, enhancing user interactions.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Mapbox GL and React Map GL:} \\
        Mapping and geospatial data are the heart of Magpie. The integration of Mapbox GL and React Map GL enables interactive, feature-rich maps. Deck.gl adds advanced visualization capabilities, such as heatmaps and clustered data points.\\
        \textbf{Mapping Features:}
        \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Dynamic Data Layers:} Users can toggle layers to focus on specific amenities like parking or bike paths.
                \item \textbf{Geospatial Analysis:} Heatmaps and visual overlays offer insights into the density and distribution of public amenities.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{ShadCN/UI and Radix Primitives:} \\
        For a consistent and accessible component library, Magpie employs ShadCN/UI, built on Radix Primitives. This integration ensures compliance with accessibility standards while enabling highly customizable UI elements.\\
        \textbf{Accessibility Focus:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{ARIA Labels:} Enhance screen reader compatibility.
            \item \textbf{Keyboard Navigation:} Interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.
            \item \textbf{Color Contrast:} Adherence to WCAG standards ensures readability.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Frontend Architecture and Design Patterns:}\\
    Magpie’s frontend is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and user-focused. The architecture adheres to modern design principles, including separation of concerns, state management, and performance optimization.\\
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Component Driven Architecture:}\\
        Every UI element is treated as a standalone, reusable component. This modularity reduces development effort and ensures consistency across the application.\\
        \textbf{Example of Key Components:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Map Interface:} Integrates Mapbox GL for geospatial visualization.
            \item \textbf{Filters and Search:} Dynamically updates the map based on user input.
            \item \textbf{Data Widgets:} Present aggregated statistics on amenities.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{State Management:}\\
        React’s Context API and hooks are used for efficient state management, reducing the need for external libraries like Redux. This keeps the codebase lightweight and focused.
        \textbf{State Management Use Cases:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{User Preferences:} Tracks theme settings, saved filters, and user-specific configurations.
            \item \textbf{API Integration:} Manages asynchronous data fetching from the backend.
            \item \textbf{Real-Time Updates:} Enables dynamic updates when new data is loaded.
        \end{itemize}
        \item  \textbf{API Integration:}
        The frontend communicates with a \emph{Go} backend via \emph{REST APIs} to fetch, update, and display data. Authentication is handled through JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure access.
