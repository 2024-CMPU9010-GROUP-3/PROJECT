\section{Prototyping}

\paragraph{A prototype is a useful design tool for testing concepts, clarifying requirements, and starting user interaction and feedback.
Prototyping methods can be categorized by fidelityâ€”ranging from low-fidelity sketches to high-fidelity digital mockup.}

\subsection{Low-fidelity prototypes}

\paragraph{Low-fidelity prototypes, which often consist of simple sketches particularly valuable in the early stages of design}
