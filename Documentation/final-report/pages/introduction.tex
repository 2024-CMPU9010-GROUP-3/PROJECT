Urbanization brings increasing demands for efficient city planning and
sustainability. \textbf{Magpie â€“ Services at a Glance} is a geographical
information service designed to address these challenges by offering a
streamlined platform for accessing and analysing public amenities. Developed as
part of the MSc in Computing (Advanced Software Development | Data Science)
group project, \textbf{Magpie} combines cutting-edge machine learning, intuitive
visualization, and robust data aggregation to provide a high-level overview of
public infrastructure.

Targeting urban planners \textbf{Magpie} simplifies the traditionally complex
and fragmented processes of data collection and analysis. By integrating
satellite imagery, automated detection techniques, and multi-layered data
visualization, the system identifies parking spots, bike infrastructure and more
-- all at a glance. Unlike existing tools that rely on manual input or advanced
GIS expertise, \textbf{Magpie} automates the extraction and fusion of real-world
data, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.

This report details the technical challenges, innovative solutions, and
real-world applications of \textbf{Magpie}. From the architecture and machine
learning methodologies to the user-centric frontend and robust backend
infrastructure, each component contributes to a powerful tool that empowers
informed decision-making and urban development.
