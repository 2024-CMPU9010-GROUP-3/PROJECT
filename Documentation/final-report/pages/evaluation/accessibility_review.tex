We requested a review of our system from Accessibility expert Damian Gordon. He served on the board of the National Disability Authority, who advise the Irish Government on all matters related to disability, and he has worked with a wide range of disability organisations, include the Centre Remedial Clinic, the National Council for the Blind, Arthritis Ireland, and the Aging Well Network. He has contributed to the development of hardware, software, legislation and training related to disability awareness and accessibility. \\\\
The goal of this review is to evaluate the accessibility of the Magpie user interface and evaluate it with regards to key accessibility general guidelines.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Accessibility: visual-auditory-cognitive-physical impairments
    \item Inclusiveness: people for who English isn't their first language, older people, gender and affective issues
    \item Universal design: an app for everyone, for different devices, different browsers and networks
\end{enumerate}

The session was conducted on November 21st during the usability testing phase of Magpie. The session was conducted online through videoconference meeting on Teams and took the following format:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Presentation of Magpie
    \item Free-roaming of the application by Damian Gordon
    \item Questionnaire
    \item Discussion \& end of review
\end{enumerate}
The questionnaire is the same as the one given to the users who participated in the usability testing. In hindsight, a tailored questionnaire should've been created for Damian Gordon, to specifically evaluate key accessibility items in Magpie.
