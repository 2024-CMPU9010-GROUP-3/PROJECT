We requested a review of our system from Accessibility export Damian Gordon. \fcolorbox{yellow}{yellow}{INTRODUCE DAMIAN BACKGROUND}.\\
The goal of this review is to evaluate the accessibility of the Magpie user interface of Magpie and evaluate it with regards to key accessibility general guidelines.\\
\fcolorbox{yellow}{yellow}{Accessibility general guidelines: outline them here} \\ \\
One session was conducted on November 21st during the usability testing phase of Magpie. The session was conducted online through videoconference meeting on Teams and took the following format:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Presentation of Magpie
    \item Free-roaming of the application by Damian Gordon
    \item Questionnaire
    \item Discussion \& end of review
\end{enumerate}
The questionnaire is the same as the one given to the users who participated in the usability testing. In hindsight, a tailored questionnaire shouldv'e been created for Damian Gordon, to specifically evaluate key accessibility items in Magpie.
