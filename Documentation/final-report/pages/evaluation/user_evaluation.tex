\subsubsection{Usability testing}
Magpie has remedied the first challenge of fragmented information on
amenities, and through this user evaluation, we hope to address the second challenge
which is making the access to this information easy, quick \& accessible.\\\\

The goal of the user evaluation is to gain feedback from real users, learn if
Magpie works as expected and assess how user-friendly it is. We will be using 2
main methods to collect both qualitative data through open-ended questions, and
quantitative data from multiple choice questions from which we will derive
insights to improve the Magpie user experience.\\\\

Our approach was as follows:
%user evaluation approach
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Round up users from the market research + seek out others
    \item Conduct online sessions to discuss Magpie, explore the features, gather feedback,
    \item Fill out satisfaction survey
    \item Synthesize notes from sessions and summarize points to improve
    \item Iteratively implement/improve features
\end{enumerate}

These sessions followed an uncontrolled usability testing approach where we let the users freely roam the application while observing their behaviour interacting with each element, guide them when they were stuck and initiate discussion on the topic of amenities, use cases for the application and feedback on features to improve.\\\\
We used a table with a list of general tasks that the user to quantitatively evaluate each feature on its ease of completion, intuitiveness and action. The list of general tasks increased as the test sessions went on because we were iteratively adding new features.\\\\
The difficulty of the task is related to if they were able to complete it and how much they struggled during it. The status of a task can either be "complete", "pass", or "fail" where "complete" is attributed when the user does the task on their own, "pass" is attributed when the user was able to complete the task but with our help, and "fail" when the user were not able to do the task even with our help. \\\\
In addition, the user's behavior is observed to give us indications on their thought process and their intuition going through a map based application like Magpie.\\\\
We also had a short satisfaction survey to quantitatively evaluate each user test session. This helps us see if Magpie improves as the test sessions go on. Each session will be presented chronologically starting with Paul.

\subsubsection{User 1 - Brendan}
Brendan is a professor with technological background. They are considered a casual user.\\\\
This was an uncontrolled test session where Brendan tested each feature of Magpie to find faults, system failures and bugs.\\\\
\textbf{Main takeaways from Brendan's session: }Magpie has potential for use by certain types of users but needs a lot more functionality. Here is a breakdown of the feedback:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Log in/Sign up: }why is a username required? Username should be the email. And email verification is a must!
    \item \textbf{Tutorial: }content of step 2 needs to be reworked, explain radius of what. Also, the positioning of certain elements is off in Firefox browser. For step 4, content wording change “dozen” for something else especially if you're planning on adding more amenity data. The step 5 should point to the map, investigate the bug.
    \item \textbf{Dashboard: }you should implement a button to clear the market and all the points from the map, right now the user has to reload. Perhaps think of leaving the count of toggled off amenities, it would depend on the use case. Maybe implement a quick reset button for  selected amenities. Compress list of amenities to avoid scrolling (window size issue in Firefox browser)
    \item \textbf{Map: } you need to add plus and minus buttons to zoom in and out of the map. Can I have more information from the amenity icons by clicking on them? Perhaps a marked up image that detects this space (google street view), information on the spot (private, free, carpark). Also, make the selected icons more visually striking, a little hover maybe
    \item \textbf{Technical: }when clicking on map, there is a slight offset between where the marker appears and where the user clicked; implement something to avoid mis-clicking and loosing original marker position; Icons move when you toggle on and off certain amenities
    \item \textbf{Misc: }why are we requesting location? For the marker data (maybe we should let the user know this is where they are on the map?); need a landing page to present magpie; is the version prototype logo useful? Maybe for dev; show more information and the ml images we worked on (personal preference); reiterates we should put the ml forward (maybe on the about us)
\end{itemize}
Overall: the interface is nice, but you might want to focus on producing a much more data-driven approach for the interface if you want to attract those kinds of users. Brendan was very tempted to click on the amenity icons of the map to find out more information.

New approach for this session - controlled ish.

\newpage
\subsubsection{User 3 - Paul}
Our second controlled session was with Paul, a student in technological undergraduate degree. They are classified as a general user, not one we have identified as our target. They left their contact email in the market research survey.\\
We initially wanted this to be a controlled test session by giving him specific tasks, but found that challenging as he intuitively went on to explore the application on his own.

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
\textbf{Main takeaways from Paul's session: }the map display and the amenity data displayed is "excellent", they would find it useful for local areas of the city. One aspect they advise we improve on is to make the choice of amenities more intuitive. This is further supported by his behaviour trying to click on the icon and subsequent amenity title on the dashboard to toggle it on and off, as well as the difficulties he encountered as shown in the general task table.\\
Another point to improve on is to make the profile and tutorial icons more visible, demonstrated by the time it took him to find them and complete the general tasks.\\\\

\textbf{Main takeaways from Livia's session: }very interesting project, useful and great; overall a very clear website. Biggest point of discontent for Livia was the tutorial, they let us know they has dyslexia and the tutorial could've been worded more effectively to cater to them and others with learning/visual impediments. In addition, they tried to interact with the locked elements during the tutorial, suggesting intuition to put in practice what they are reading to validate the information absorbed.\\\\
They also suggested adding more amenities such as public transports stops, scooter stands and student hubs. They liked how it was easier to understand the information visually compared to Google maps or Apple maps.\\\\

Our next test session was with Ben, another student in a technological post-graduate degree. They are also identified as a casual user who also left their contact in the market research survey.\\\\
Starting this session, we took a more uncontrolled approach and let the users free roam the application without giving them specific tasks to complete. We guided them in the beginning and initiated certain discussions but overall let the users take the reign and think aloud during their exploration process.\\\\

\end{table}
\textbf{Main takeaways from Ben's session: }the application does exactly what we described it to do- a GIS application to give a at a glance of amenities in Dublin. The overall impression is that it's a very helpful application, easy to use and effective.\\
Points to improve are the loading times for the amenity points, perhaps  directly being logged in after sign up to avoid repetitive steps, make the profile and tutorial icons more visible as they blend into the map, remove mac keyboard icons from the profile bubble, and if possible add more information on each amenity perhaps with tooltips, or add more amenity data like public transportation.\\\\

\end{table}
\textbf{Main takeaways from Jakub's session: }this tool simplifies the search for amenities however there are certain items that need to be considered to improve the application:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Log in/Sign up: }Email verification should be included, so that the user can confirm they have successfully signed up and also for security purposes.
    \item \textbf{Map: }some of the amenity data doesn't have accurate locations, for example public toilets seem to be off by longitude, and multi-storey parking data seems incomplete. Also, water fountains are very hard to find on the map, we should consider changing its colour. Same with the profile and tutorial icon, they are hard to spot on the map. They would also like to double click on the map to clear it, more intuitive for them. And last thing, amenities with small count are hard to find in the radius, maybe make them more visible somehow.
    \item \textbf{History feature: }doesn't see the use for a casual user, and again same for this tool, doesn't see the use for them as a casual user but could be useful for a target user.
    \item \textbf{Extra features: }Search functionality would be very useful for those that are lookin for a spot but don't know where it is located visually. Also, an export feature would be useful for the scenario of urban planning, if I'm to put a report together, a visual from this tool would be helpful for illustration.
