\subsubsection{Application Security}
\textbf{Fix Issues with JWTs}\\
As mentioned in the discussion of JSON Web Tokens on page \pageref{jwt}, the use
of JWTs comes with its own set of caveats.

One solution for this issue would be implementing a list of revoked tokens on
the server and offering the user a way to add a stolen token to that list. If an
attacker then uses one of these revoked tokens, their requests can be easily
denied.

\textbf{Implement Email-based Features}\\
Right at the end of the project, the team experimented with email-based features
like email verification and password reset. Unfortunately, emails sent by our
system were always classified either classified as spam or didn't get delivered
at all as they were considered untrustworthy. Since the deadline was fast
approaching, the team decided to abandon this idea and focus on other issues.

Nonetheless, these features are essential components for any public facing web
application. This is why one of the next steps would be to implement email
verification and password reset using a service like SendGrid. This way, the
issue of emails being blocked automatically should be mitigated. email
verification, forgot password

\textbf{Replacing bcrypt}\\
Switching out bcrypt for Argon2id is not as pressing as other issues on this
list as it is still functional and secure, but sometime in the future it would
be a good idea to switch to a newer password encryption solution. This would
bring Magpie in line with the current recommendations for secure password
storage by the \textcite{owasp_password_storage_cheatsheet}.

Replacing the bcrypt library would make it necessary to reset the passwords of
all users, as it is not possible to convert a bcrypt hash to a Argon2id hash.
This should therefore be done before the number of users grows to affect as few
people as possible.

The issue of improving application security was kept in mind during the whole
development process, but other issues always took precedence. Given more time,
improving the application security would be one of the top priorities in terms
of further backend development.
