\subsubsection{Application Security}
As mentioned in the discussion of JSON Web Tokens on page \pageref{jwt}, the use
of JWTs comes with its own set of caveats.

One solution for this issue would be implementing a list of revoked tokens on
the server and offering the user a way to add a stolen token to that list. If an
attacker then uses one of these revoked tokens, their requests can be easily
denied. However, this added complexity and development time that the team didn't
have in the MVP phase of the project. So to mitigate the issue, the JWTs were
given a very short expiration time, making them useless after only a few hours.
This led to annoyance and friction during development and testing, so the
expiration time was increased to a week. This made the application less secure,
but much easier to use in both development and regular usage. The backend team
took a unanimous decision to keep the token handling in this state for the time
being, as the application was still considered very much secure enough. The time
and effort needed to implement those additional security features were weighed
up and it became obvious that they would not result in any easily perceptible
improvement to the application.

The issue of improving application security was kept in mind during the whole
development process, but other issues always took precedence. Given more time,
improving the application security would be one of the top priorities in terms
of further backend development.
