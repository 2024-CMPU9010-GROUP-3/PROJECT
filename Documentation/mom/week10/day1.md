### **3. Discussion and Key Points**

1. **Group Leader Assignment:**

   - **Andreas** volunteered to be the group leader for the week

2. **Task Updates:**

   - **Saul:** Focused on the dashboard UI elements, specifically merging the attributes and table section into one interactive element. Users will be able to tick boxes instead of selecting attributes manually.
   - **Steven:** Worked on resolving pull requests with merge conflicts in the main branch, particularly affecting authentication. He also restored the "Terms" branch and plans to finalize it before tackling new tasks, which will be discussed during sprint planning.
   - **Andreas:** Addressed a bug in the front-end login and registration system where redirects were not functioning properly. He has identified a workaround and will continue working on these issues.
   - **Jessica:** Finalized parking detection improvements and prepared for a pull request. She plans to start working on evaluation tasks once detection adjustments are validated.
   - **Anais:** Continued scheduling usability tests, awaiting confirmation from participants. She is preparing to conduct tests once the front end is in a better state.

3. **Discussion on Merge Conflicts and Future Tasks:**

   - Steven was asked to prioritize resolving the merge conflicts on the pull requests, as these are blocking other progress. Kaustubh suggested postponing new tasks until the conflicts are resolved.

4. **Frontend Banner and Suggestions:**

   - Saul reminded Steven of the unresolved changes to the front-end banner based on last weekâ€™s suggestions. Steven agreed to address these issues.

5. **Sprint Planning and Retrospectives:**

   - The team agreed to conduct sprint planning at 7:30 PM to assign tasks for the week. Kaustubh reminded everyone to submit their "mad/sad/glad" retrospectives for compilation.

6. **Next Steps:**
   - **Saul:** Complete dashboard UI updates and improve user interaction design.
   - **Steven:** Resolve pull requests and finalize banner changes.
   - **Jessica:** Validate parking detection model changes and start evaluation tasks.
   - **Anais:** Finalize usability testing preparation.
   - **Andreas:** Finalize login functionality and address redirection issues.
