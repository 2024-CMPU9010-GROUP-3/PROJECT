### **3. Discussion and Key Points**

1. **Image Data Preparation:**

   - Jessica completed gathering images using coordinates from datasets. However, image quality issues were identified, with difficulties in spotting parking spaces due to pixelation.
   - The team discussed using a subtractive approach, focusing on identifying cars in the images and then eliminating those on roads to detect parking areas.
   - Various zoom levels and image resolutions were considered to improve image quality. The current images are at zoom level 18 or 19, but the maximum is 22, which might offer better detail.

2. **Presentation Planning:**

   - Team members discussed the structure for the upcoming demo presentation, including system design, progress updates, and live demos.
   - It was agreed that each presenter would cover different aspects of the project, with Kaustubh leading the system design discussion.
   - The presentation will start with a use case scenario for better engagement, followed by detailed updates on development.

3. **Improving Image Quality:**

   - Alternatives for enhancing image resolution were explored, such as increasing pixel dimensions (e.g., 800x800) or using AI-based techniques for upscaling.
   - The team will continue experimenting with different settings in Mapbox to find the optimal configuration for the images used in machine learning.

4. **Model Training Considerations:**

   - The team discussed the limitations of current data and the importance of pre-processing before training the machine learning model.
   - Suggestions included rotating images and potentially converting to monochrome if it improved detection results, with plans for further testing.

5. **Task Assignments for Demo Preparation:**
   - Andreas volunteered to handle the system demo, while other team members were assigned sections on the project progress and specific tasks accomplished.
   - A follow-up meeting will be held to review the presentation slides and make necessary adjustments.
