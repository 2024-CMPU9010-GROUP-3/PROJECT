### **3. Discussion and Key Points**

1. **Presentation Feedback:**

   - The team reflected on the recent presentation and acknowledged the need for a less formal approach in future demos.
   - It was noted that the flow was generally good, but more emphasis on informal updates and progress demonstrations would be beneficial.
   - Kaustubh and the team discussed taking steps to equalize speaking time among members to ensure a balanced presentation.

2. **Labeling and Data Annotation:**

   - Label Studio’s current setup presented challenges with synchronization and proper annotation tracking. Alternatives for configuration and other tools were considered.
   - The team discussed leveraging the YOLO model to automate labeling as much as possible, with the possibility of fine-tuning using manual adjustments afterward.
   - Concerns were raised about ensuring that labeled data remains consistent and integrates correctly into the shared dataset.

3. **Improving Machine Learning Processes:**

   - Strategies to automate the labeling process using YOLO and reduce the workload for manual labeling were explored.
   - Discussion on handling cars detected on roads, with plans to use geometric data to filter out irrelevant detections.
   - The idea of creating a script to subtract coordinates overlapping with road areas was proposed to improve data accuracy.

4. **Sprint Planning for Next Week:**

   - Kaustubh will serve as team lead next week, organizing an extended meeting on Monday to conduct sprint planning and a retrospective.
   - The team agreed to standardize the daily stand-ups by following a consistent format, with each member providing updates on their tasks.
   - Labels and organization in GitHub were recognized as crucial for tracking progress, and Saul suggested improvements to the labeling system.

5. **Next Steps for Development:**
   - Andreas will continue refining back-end configurations, including geoJSON output for data points.
   - Work will proceed on addressing synchronization issues with annotation tools and experimenting with YOLO for labeling.
   - The team will ensure that labeling tasks can be completed efficiently within the next week to prepare for further model training.
