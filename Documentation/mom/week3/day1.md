1. **Front-End and Back-End Integration:**
   - The team is working on connecting the front end with the back end, with key routes being defined.
   - Testing is required to ensure the connection works effectively, with Kaustubh and Steven handling integration tasks.
   - There are two primary front-end tasks: user authentication pages and linking the front end to the back end.

2. **User Authentication:**
   - The plan is to implement user authentication using JWT tokens, with the option to store these tokens in cookies for session management.
   - Andreas confirmed that the back end will handle authentication via defined routes.
   - GDPR compliance will be considered later, but for now, it isnâ€™t a priority as the project is still in the demo phase.

3. **Machine Learning and Data Preparation:**
   - Jessica and Anais are researching labeling techniques for parking slot detection using images from Mapbox.
   - They will also explore pre-training models for classification and box creation for labeled data.

4. **Sprint Planning and Task Organization:**
   - Agreed to create a Gantt chart or use the roadmap feature to visualize milestones.
   - The team will follow Agile principles, planning one-week sprints to keep track of progress.
   - There was a discussion on setting up a sprint planning call either today or tomorrow morning, to finalize the weekly goals.

5. **Task Allocation and Collaboration:**
   - Each team member has tasks assigned, with a focus on front-end, back-end, and machine learning preparation.
