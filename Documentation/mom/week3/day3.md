### **3. Discussion and Key Points**

1. **Deployment and Environment Setup:**
   - Ongoing efforts to integrate environment variables into the code for accessing Mapbox during runtime.
   - The deployment process is progressing, with work on Docker Compose and plans for a Kubernetes deployment.
   - The app will be hosted on a website after successful deployment configuration.

2. **Data Gathering Updates:**
   - Jessica and Anais, with Steven's help, are generating images from the Mapbox API using coordinates from datasets found on data.gov.ie.
   - Over 2,000 images have been collected so far, but the datasets contain varied information, making manual filtering necessary to ensure relevant parking data.
   - The team will continue refining the dataset and prepare for labeling the images.

3. **Machine Learning Preparations:**
   - Discussed pre-processing steps, such as converting images to monochrome or rotating them, but noted limitations due to low pixel density.
   - Agreed to experiment with different pre-processing techniques and train the model with various data formats to determine the most effective approach.

4. **Front-End and Back-End Integration:**
   - Steven is working on authentication features and facing challenges with connecting the front end to the back end.
   - The solution involves specifying the correct URL and port for the back end, currently using localhost configurations, with plans to adjust for production environments.

5. **Wiki and Documentation Updates:**
   - Steven updated the project wiki to include information on related research and similar projects.
   - Progress is being made on user authentication pages, with improvements to password security and input validation.
