### **3. Discussion and Key Points**

1. **Survey Analysis and Usability Testing Preparations:**
   - **Anais** reported that survey data analysis is taking longer than expected but is near completion. She plans to start drafting usability testing questions tonight.
   - An email was sent to Andrea for an expert review, and Anais will gather user email addresses to distribute the survey, including friends and family for broader feedback.

2. **SOPs and Data Security Improvements:**
   - **Saul** worked on setting up SOPs for secure data sharing and encountered some complexities with multi-user SOPs. He conducted additional research and will continue implementing SOPs today, aiming for streamlined security protocols.

3. **UI and Front-End Updates:**
   - **Kaustubh** nearly completed his diary submission and will shift focus to implementing additional data types on the front end.
   - **Steven** made updates to the UI, particularly for the login page redirection. He also explored options for implementing a "forgot password" feature and plans to consult Saul on this addition.

4. **Backend and API Filter Function:**
   - **Andreas** successfully implemented a filter function in the API, allowing users to retrieve points based on specific types within a specified radius. He worked on resolving failing unit tests and continues to refine this feature.

5. **Machine Learning Model Adjustments:**
   - **Jessica** updated the YOLO model to use oriented bounding boxes, which affected the size and orientation of the bounding boxes. She adjusted the thresholds to accommodate these changes but encountered issues with variable box dimensions. Further refinements are in progress.

6. **Presentation Preparation and Final Touches:**
   - The team agreed to start the PowerPoint preparation for tomorrowâ€™s presentation, with each member contributing their updates.
   - **Andreas** was advised to discuss his recent work on API filters and unit tests, while **Jessica** and **Anais** will cover updates on the machine learning model and survey insights.

7. **Next Steps and Retrospectives:**
   - The team will review the SOPs and other updates in a follow-up discussion later tonight. Members were reminded to submit diary entries daily for easier compilation.
   - Kaustubh and Steven discussed plans for final adjustments to session management and cookie handling for GDPR compliance.
