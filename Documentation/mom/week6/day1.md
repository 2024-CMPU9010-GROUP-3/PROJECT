### **3. Discussion and Key Points**

1. **Task Updates:**

   - **Saul:** Worked on the presentation and completed final elements of the machine learning training tasks last Friday. For this week, Saul plans to focus on writing the document.
   - **Andreas:** Has been working on unit tests and has a better understanding of the process. However, Andreas will pause the unit testing to focus on the report, which he will complete alongside Saul.
   - **Kaustubh:** Completed work on the UX documents and made updates to the map. The map now returns the coordinates of the top left and bottom right of the bounding box around the marker, based on the slider adjustments. These changes have already been pushed and merged into the repository.
   - **Anais:** Finished the survey and sent it out last week. Spent time reading research papers on YOLO tuning and plans to complete labeling and tuning the model today.
   - **Jessica:** Finished the parking detection script, which correctly returns car coordinates. However, some issues were identified with road masking, as highways are not consistently masked. Jessica will continue refining this aspect and is also working on sending the data to the back end.

2. **Front-End and Back-End Integration:**

   - The login functionality was tested and is working properly. Steven will continue working on UI design and enhancing the front-end experience.
   - Documentation is available for the back end, and the next step will be ensuring proper communication between the parking detection script and the back-end services.

3. **Upcoming Tasks:**
   - The team agreed to finalize work on their respective tasks by the end of the week. A specific focus will be placed on integrating the machine learning model into the application and refining the UI/UX elements.
   - A Scrum planning session is scheduled for tonight at 8:30 PM to finalize the timeline for the report and divide responsibilities.
