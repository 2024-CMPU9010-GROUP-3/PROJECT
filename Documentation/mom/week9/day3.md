### **3. Discussion and Key Points**

1. **Expert Review with Andrea:**
   - **Anais** confirmed feedback from Andrea, clarifying that the upcoming report does not need to include user evaluation results but should outline the methods and planned evaluation.
   - The team agreed this approach provides flexibility, focusing on documenting current progress and plans without rushing incomplete user evaluation data.

2. **Dashboard and UI Adjustments:**
   - **Saul** worked on tidying up the dashboard layout to avoid conflicts with data display, aiming to improve user interaction.
   - **Kaustubh** continued refining the layout, ensuring dashboard elements are structured and easy to navigate for users.

3. **User Testing Preparation and Recruitment:**
   - **Anais** prepared forms for usability testing and received two confirmed participants. She will re-email potential testers and reach out to ensure at least five participants, as suggested by Damien.
   - The team discussed the recruitment strategy, considering friends and family as additional testers if necessary.

4. **Parking Detection Model Improvements:**
   - **Jessica** addressed issues with the parking detection model, specifically aligning bounding boxes correctly for horizontal and vertical slots. She implemented changes using oriented bounding boxes from the YOLO model, which includes width, height, and rotation for better accuracy.

5. **Login Bug and Session Management:**
   - **Andreas** focused on refactoring the login functionality to use session management rather than cookies, aiming to resolve persistent bugs with the login flow. He plans to finalize these updates shortly, with a goal to ensure a stable user experience.

6. **Follow-Up and Next Steps:**
   - **Anais** will continue user recruitment and finalize usability testing documentation.
   - **Jessica** to validate the parking model adjustments and test accuracy improvements.
   - **Andreas** will complete session management refactoring and address any additional bugs identified.
