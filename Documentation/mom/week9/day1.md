### **3. Discussion and Key Points**

1. **UI and Color Scheme Adjustments:**
   - **Kaustubh** highlighted the need for more distinctive colors, as suggested by Andreas, to enhance usability and visual clarity.
   - The team agreed that marker data should only display selected amenities to avoid clutter. Kaustubh suggested considering the needs of city planners who may need to see both available and missing amenities.

2. **User Evaluation Report Structure:**
   - **Anais** shared insights from other reports, noting that past projects often focused on the testing methodology and planned actions rather than raw feedback. She proposed including the testing approach and prototypes to strengthen the report, even if user feedback is limited by the deadline.
   - **Saul** expressed a preference for including preliminary results if possible, and the team plans to incorporate Andrea’s feedback post-review.

3. **Login Functionality and Bug Fixes:**
   - **Steven** mentioned ongoing issues with the login page, including caching problems and the persistence of an outdated icon on the top right. Andreas recommended reworking the login to use local storage instead of cookies for session management.
   - Andreas committed to finalizing these changes once Steven’s current updates are merged.

4. **Front-End Layout and Icon Adjustments:**
   - **Steven** will add the Magpie logo to the login and main pages. He will also remove placeholder text and align the avatar and other icons as per team suggestions.

5. **Upcoming Tasks and Responsibilities:**
   - **Saul** will finish integrating SOPs and start implementing a site tour function based on Kaustubh’s notes.
   - **Jessica** continues refining parking detection, particularly focusing on accurate empty space identification.
   - **Anais** will finalize usability testing questions in Microsoft Forms, ensuring structured feedback collection.
   - **Andreas** will refactor the login functionality for consistency across environments.

6. **Sprint Planning and Team Lead:**
   - The team agreed on **Andreas** as the team lead for this week.
   - Sprint planning was scheduled for 7:30 PM to set priorities and outline the next steps.

7. **Retrospective Feedback:**
   - Team members will submit their retrospectives directly to Andreas, focusing on recent project successes, challenges, and areas for improvement.
