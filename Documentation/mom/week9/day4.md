### **3. Discussion and Key Points**

1. **User Evaluation Report and Presentation Progress:**

   - **Anais** is focused on finalizing the user evaluation report and presentation. She shared a draft PDF in the group chat and is synthesizing the remaining sections. Formatting will be handled later today.
   - The team agreed that the presentation will be divided after 4 PM to ensure all report content is finalized before creating slides.

2. **Bounding Box Adjustments for Parking Detection:**

   - **Jessica** updated the bounding box configurations to improve rotation accuracy. However, distinguishing between horizontal and vertical orientations remains challenging during testing.
   - She is validating all four use cases to ensure proper model functionality, but reviewing image outputs continues to be time-consuming.

3. **Sign-Up Functionality and Username Integration:**

   - **Steven** addressed ongoing issues with the login and sign-up flow. He proposed removing username requirements from the backend, as usernames currently add complexity without clear utility.
   - The team debated whether to continue requiring usernames. **Anais** recalled feedback from Andrea suggesting that personalized welcome messages would enhance user experience. The username could serve as a fallback in the absence of first and last names.

4. **GDPR Compliance and Data Collection:**

   - **Saul** emphasized adhering to GDPR principles by only collecting data with clear utility. Requiring first and last names would not align with these principles, as they serve no functional purpose in the current application.

5. **Next Steps:**
   - **Anais** to complete the report and presentation drafts by 4 PM for team review.
   - **Jessica** to finalize bounding box validation and prepare data for model testing.
   - **Andreas** will proceed with either removing or adjusting the username requirement based on group consensus.
