### **3. Discussion and Key Points**

1. **User Evaluation Report and Questionnaire:**
   - **Anais** updated on the progress of the user evaluation report, mentioning the addition of figures and preparation for the user testing questionnaire. She plans to finish the experimental methods section and add more figures by the end of the day.

2. **Front-End Issues with Mapbox Icons:**
   - **Kaustubh** encountered difficulties with recoloring Mapbox icons, noting that customizing icons for different map layers proved challenging and time-consuming. While he adjusted layers to display fewer data points at wider zoom levels, customizing colors remains an issue.

3. **Logo and UI Updates:**
   - **Steven** worked on integrating the Magpie logo into the main and login pages, creating a logo component. He also linked the terms and privacy pages, with the logo redirecting users to the home page upon login. Further adjustments to the cookie consent banner and layout refinements are ongoing.

4. **Onboarding Flow and Main Page Display:**
   - **Saul** finalized the onboarding flow and began exploring ways to improve the main page display. He aims to enhance the presentation of key information on the dashboard, trying out various layouts for optimal clarity.

5. **Parking Detection Model Adjustments:**
   - **Jessica** continued refining the parking detection model, addressing issues with parking alignment. She identified cases where parking orientations didn’t match expectations and plans to improve the model’s accuracy by overlaying road data to reduce false positives.

6. **Session Management and Backend Integration:**
   - **Andreas** made significant progress on the backend and frontend session management, resolving earlier complexities. He will finalize and clean up the code for a stable push soon.

7. **Presentation Preparation:**
   - **Kaustubh** reminded the team that the presentation, due Thursday, will be a condensed version of the report. The team plans to start working on it once the report draft is complete, with an anticipated preparation time of a few hours.

8. **Next Steps:**
   - **Anais** to finalize the user evaluation and prepare the questionnaire for distribution.
   - **Jessica** to continue improving the parking detection model.
   - **Steven** and **Andreas** to complete front-end and backend integration tasks for seamless session management.
