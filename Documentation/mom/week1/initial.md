### **3. Discussion and Key Points**

1. **Project Direction:**

   - The goal is to build a mapping application that integrates various data sources, such as bike routes, parking spaces, and local facilities.
   - The project aims to make this information accessible and valuable, especially for civil servants and businesses.

2. **Geospatial Data Analysis:**

   - Discussion on the feasibility of using satellite imagery to detect parking spaces and differentiate between road types.
   - The challenge of detecting on-street parking areas using satellite images due to resolution limitations.
   - Possibilities of training models to recognize specific road features.

3. **Target Audience and Use Cases:**
   - Primary focus on civil servants but not exclusively. The tool could be valuable for businesses (e.g., food trucks) assessing location feasibility.
   - Discussion on the flexibility of the project to accommodate different user stories and needs.
4. **Modular Development Approach:**

   - Suggestion to break down the project into microservices with well-defined API specifications.
   - Each module should function independently while adhering to a unified development framework.

5. **Development Methodology:**

   - Agreement to use Agile practices, specifically a Kanban-style project board.
   - Daily meetings were suggested to keep the team aligned.

6. **Next Steps:**
   - Set up GitHub for code collaboration.
   - Develop a presentation summarizing the project idea for review next week.
   - Consider including basic mapping features in the demo.
