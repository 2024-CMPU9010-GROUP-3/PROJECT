   - It was noted that feedback from presentations consistently pointed out the slow progress on the front end. The team agreed that the pace of front-end development needs to improve.
   - Saul committed to taking on more front-end tasks now that his distribution work is largely completed.
   - The need to showcase UI/UX elements in the next demo was emphasized, as other teams have been able to show such work.

4. **Presentation Strategy:**
   - A less formal approach will be taken in future presentations to better engage the audience.
   - The next presentation will feature more visuals, including UI/UX screenshots, and showcase progress on both the backend and frontend sides.
