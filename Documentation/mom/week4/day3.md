### **3. Discussion and Key Points**

1. **Agenda Item 1:**
   - Andreas has finished implementing routes for the backend and fixed a bug.
   - Jessica tried running the pre-trained model (YOLO) in label-studio to automate the image labelling process. The model is connected successfully but is not able to provide predictions. After a lot of troubleshooting she decided to try running the model in google colab. The results were not as expected. She has decided to label the images manually or look for another alternative.
   - Anais has finalized on market research survey. She was also helping Jessica with trying one last method to perform auto-labelling the images. If that does not work, we will resort to manual labelling.
   - Steven has fixed bugs on the frontend login page.
   - Saul was working on Kubernetes deployment for Friday’s demo.
2. **Agenda Item 2:**
   - Andreas is going to work on ticket “connection credentials for database”.
   - Jessica will be working on trying an alternative model to perform auto labelling, if this does not work, she will start labelling images manually. The entire team is ready to help her with this.
   - Anais is compiling a list of civil departments, office of public works and other potential options. She will also be sending an email to Andrea to discuss how to go about contacting different departments.
   - Steven will be working on cookie banner and connecting the frontend with the backend. He will also start with testing in the frontend. He also proposed to make the video if Kaustubh is not able to as he is sick.
   - Saul will continue to work on the Kubernetes deployment for Friday’s demo and he will also be adding meeting notes to GitHub.
3. Agenda Item 3:
   - Saul has suggested that we start training our model with the images we have already labelled manually.
