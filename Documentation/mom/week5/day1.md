### **3. Discussion and Key Points**

1. **Task Updates:**
   - **Kaustubh:** Worked on Swagger documentation and DL tasks earlier in the week but was unable to complete work on Wednesday and Thursday due to illness. Plans to work on UX documentation today and tomorrow, based on Andreaâ€™s feedback from the last meeting.
   - **Andreas:** Focused on bug fixes to prepare the distribution for the back-end, and set up CORS configurations to allow front-end and back-end communication. Plans to work on authentication middleware for protected routes today.
   - **Jessica & Anais:** Has been retraining the YOLO model with new images. Faced some challenges but is optimistic about finishing the labeling today and assisting Kaustubh with UI/UX documentation.
   - **Steven:** Reported progress on front-end development, successfully tested CORS and authentication functions. However, an issue with sign-up functionality resulted in an error 500, which he plans to fix today.
   - **Saul:** Completed the distribution of the front-end code and is now focusing on front-end tickets. He will work on the Next.js code to integrate the front end with the back end.

2. **Machine Learning Model and Labeling:**
   - The team discussed the use of the YOLO model for labeling images and explored the potential of converting the model to TensorFlow for easier implementation of transfer learning. Jessica will complete labeling tasks and assist with documentation.

3. **Front-End and Back-End Integration:**
   - Saul and Andreas discussed continuing integration between the front end and back end. Saul is now taking on front-end tickets, focusing on Next.js code rather than UI/UX work.

4. **Next Steps:**
   - Kaustubh will finalize UX documentation.
   - The team will focus on integrating and testing the front-end and back-end components.
   - A sprint planning meeting will be held later this week to address remaining tasks.
