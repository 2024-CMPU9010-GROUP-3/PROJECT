### **3. Discussion and Key Points**

1. **Labeling and Detection of Parking Spaces:**

   - Discussion revolved around parking space detection and the process of identifying spaces even when no cars are present. The goal is to ensure that parking spaces are correctly inferred, based on existing cars and space calculations.
   - Some concerns were raised regarding the scope of this task, but the team agreed it would be a beneficial addition and should be incorporated if time allows. Andreas and Anais will continue working on it.

2. **Front-End and Back-End Integration:**

   - Steven worked on fixing login issues, and further progress was made in terms of connecting the front end with the back end. Andreas is addressing error handling and working with Steven on unit tests for smoother integration.

3. **Report Progress:**

   - Saul and Andreas volunteered to focus on the report next week, splitting the writing responsibilities while the rest of the team focuses on other tasks.
   - Steven and Kaustubh will continue developing the front end, with a focus on enhancing user experience and visual elements for the upcoming demo.
   - The report will require input from everyone, so team members working on the front end and machine learning tasks will also contribute to specific sections.

4. **Upcoming Interim Submission and Demo Preparation:**

   - The team discussed the upcoming interim report, noting that it will be essential to showcase the progress made so far, including parking detection and model training results.
   - Jessica and Anais will focus on refining the machine learning model to ensure that detected spaces and output data are accurate.

5. **Survey Finalization:**
   - Anais shared the updated survey draft, incorporating feedback from Damien. The team will review and provide any final comments before it is sent out to gather data.
