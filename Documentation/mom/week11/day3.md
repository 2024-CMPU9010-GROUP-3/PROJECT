2. **Parking Classification and Model Refinements:**

   - The team discussed Jessicaâ€™s proposal to add a parking lot category and refine classifications for on-street and private parking. While it was noted that parking lots could be public or private, adding a general parking lot label was agreed upon to improve data representation.

3. **Docker and Database Connection Issues:**

   - **Steven** reported that Docker fails to connect to the database on his machine, leading to a 500 error on the front end.
   - **Andreas** suggested checking environment variables in the `.env` file and ensuring the backend is running properly within Docker.

4. **Feedback on Expanding Website Testing:**

   - The team discussed whether to expand user testing to a broader audience, such as casual users. It was decided to focus on receiving feedback from professional users, such as architects and urban planners, before considering a public release.

5. **Reminders:**
   - **Anais** reminded team members to submit retrospectives by 4 PM.
   - **Kaustubh** will finalize the homepage updates before his next availability.
