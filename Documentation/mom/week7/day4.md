### **3. Discussion and Key Points**

1. **Interim Report Feedback:**
   - Saul shared positive feedback on the interim report, with indications of high marks. Concerns about earlier feedback were mostly resolved, and the team felt relieved that prior worries were unnecessary.
   - The team acknowledged that treating feedback as constructive was essential, and they would aim for clarity in future reports.

2. **Script and Backend Improvements:**
   - **Saul** modified the data sending script to use multi-threading with a single connection, significantly reducing upload time from three hours to two minutes. He will adapt Jessica’s send points to support additional data types once **Andreas** updates the backend.
   - **Andreas** added a migration system to the database, facilitating easier updates without needing to reset. He also plans to set up a Docker container for PostGIS, aligning the project with the updated backend infrastructure.

3. **Data and Coordinate Transformation:**
   - **Jessica** worked on adapting data from various sources, transforming non-standard coordinate systems into the correct format. She also progressed on parking detection enhancements.
   - **Anais** focused on cleaning up her workspace and organizing models and code. She also sent additional survey reminders and plans to compile responses for the team.

4. **Survey Update:**
   - **Anais** reported receiving over 20 responses, including several from government workers, with architects and construction companies also contributing valuable insights. She will compile the responses by the end of the day to incorporate them into tomorrow’s presentation.

5. **Presentation Preparation:**
   - The team discussed the need for a PowerPoint covering weekly updates, with **Jessica** volunteering to create the template. Team members agreed to add their sections, focusing on recent progress, technical updates, and survey insights.
   - **Steven** worked on implementing a cookie consent banner for GDPR compliance and collaborated with **Kaustubh** on session management adjustments to meet regulatory requirements.

6. **Future Machine Learning Tasks:**
   - The team explored ideas for further machine learning applications beyond parking detection but struggled to identify additional useful models. They decided to monitor survey feedback for potential feature suggestions that could inform future ML tasks.
