## ⚙️ Using the development container

This directory uses a dev container to aid LaTeX documentation. To use it, you will need:

- to have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine
- to have the [dev container extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed in VS Code

Once installed, open the command pallet with `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container`. Then select `Documentation` to open the documentation folder in a dev container.
