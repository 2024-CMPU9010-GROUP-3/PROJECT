### **1. Mad**

- **Interim Report Requirements**: Some frustration arose regarding the requirements for the interim report. Expected word counts and formatting guidelines from the slides and templates were initially understood to be mandatory, only for the team to find out they were not strictly enforced. This miscommunication created confusion and an unexpected adjustment in approach.
- **Report Feedback**: The feedback for the interim report was not as positive as anticipated, given the effort invested. Previous feedback prior to submission suggested the report was on track, which led to unexpected disappointment.

### **2. Sad**

- **Unit Testing Challenges**: One team member expressed regret over the time taken to implement unit testing in the backend. They noted that had TDD been employed from the start, it would have streamlined the process.
- **Feedback on Interim Deliverables**: Some team members felt that the interim presentation and report did not receive as much positive feedback as in previous weeks, which was disheartening after significant effort.
- **Uncertain Feature Direction**: Concern was raised over aligning on the implementation path for additional features. There is hope for a unified vision that the team can execute within the remaining timeline.

### **3. Glad**

- **Teamwork in Presentation**: The interim presentation was a success, with all members contributing effectively. The team’s quick adjustments the night before demonstrated strong collaboration.
- **ML Model Progress**: Progress with the Machine Learning model tuning was celebrated, with significant advancements noted.
- **Positive User Flow Implementation**: The team successfully implemented a complete user flow, which was demonstrated during the presentation. This was a significant milestone and received positive feedback.
- **MVP Deployment**: The successful deployment of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) marked a key achievement in the project’s timeline.
