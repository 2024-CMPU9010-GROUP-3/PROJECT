### **1. Mad**

While no strong frustrations were explicitly voiced, there is a subtle sense of dissatisfaction in some areas. This may stem from unclear roles, processes, or general inefficiencies that are not being directly addressed. It’s important to dig deeper into these areas to better understand any underlying concerns.

### **2. Sad**

Several team members expressed concerns about their progress and speed:

- **Progress Speed**: A few team members feel that they are not working as efficiently as they would like.
- **Contribution**: Some feel like they are not contributing as much as they could, particularly in specific tasks like setting up tools (e.g., Label Studio) or wishing for more involvement in areas like Machine Learning.

### **3. Glad**

There were several positive aspects highlighted during the retrospective:

- **Presentation Feedback**: Everyone was generally satisfied with the presentation process and the positive feedback received across the board.
- **Collaboration**: The team is happy with the level of cooperation and engagement in meaningful tasks. There’s a shared sense that the team is working well together and contributing in a valuable way.

### **Action Items:**

- Investigate areas where progress speed can be improved and identify potential blockers.
- Clarify roles and responsibilities to ensure everyone feels they are contributing meaningfully.
- Continue leveraging strong teamwork and capitalize on the positive presentation feedback for future improvements.
