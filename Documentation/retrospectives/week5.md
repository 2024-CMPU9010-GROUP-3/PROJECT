### **1. Mad**

A few team members found themselves frustrated due to technical issues:

- **Login Errors**: There were difficulties related to setting up the login page.
- **Label Studio Issues**: Challenges with setting up the Label Studio Ml Backend extension caused some frustration, slowing down progress.

### **2. Sad**

Several team members felt that their pace and contribution were not up to their expectations:

- **Progress Speed**: Multiple people expressed concerns about working at a slower pace than desired, including feeling unproductive due to illness.
- **Contribution**: Some team members felt they didn’t contribute as much as they had hoped during the week, and that tasks were taking longer than anticipated.
- **Frontend Feedback**: Critical feedback during the presentation on the frontend design was another source of discontent.

### **3. Glad**

Despite the challenges, there were several positive takeaways:

- **ML Success**: The labelling using a pretrained model was finally working, and the model gave very promising results.
- **Presentation Feedback**: Most team members were happy with how the presentation went and received positive feedback.

### **Action Items:**

- **Improve Progress Speed**: Help team members who feel they are falling behind by identifying specific blockers or improving task prioritization.
- **Leverage Positive Momentum**: Build on the positive feedback to encourage further engagement and celebrate successes.
