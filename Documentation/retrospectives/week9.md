### **1. Mad**

- A team member tends to dominate presentations, frequently answering questions and engaging with professors in ways that may negatively impact evaluations.
- Some code changes reintroduced previously resolved issues due to insufficient diligence and oversight.
- Extended delays in resolving issues, such as login functionality, have hindered progress.

### **2. Sad**

- Difficulties with new tools (e.g., LaTeX) impacted productivity, leading to work that did not meet expected standards.
- Late adoption of necessary tools (e.g., xywhr) resulted in inefficiencies and wasted time.
- Critical feedback on the frontend, as well as repeated comments on the perceived lack of the app’s utility, were demotivating.
- Frustration arose from unresolved bugs and features not functioning as intended.

### **3. Glad**

- The user evaluation presentation was well-executed, reflecting strong teamwork on both the presentation and report.
- Progress in frontend development is accelerating, with measurable improvements now evident.
- The team is successfully completing older tasks and is motivated to tackle upcoming challenges.
- Collaboration and overall progress remain strong and steady.

### **Action Items:**

- Enhance Presentation Dynamics:
  Encourage equitable participation during presentations. Allocate roles in advance to ensure balanced contribution and professionalism when responding to feedback.

- Strengthen Code Review Processes:
  Implement a more rigorous code review system to catch potential reintroductions of resolved issues and improve overall code quality.

- Prioritize Tool Training:
  Schedule dedicated training sessions for key tools (e.g., LaTeX, xywhr) early in the project timeline to ensure efficiency and maintain quality standards.

- Address Frontend Criticisms:
  Act on specific feedback regarding the frontend and explore ways to demonstrate the app’s utility more effectively during evaluations.

- Resolve Login and Other Critical Issues:
  Allocate resources and establish a timeline to address and resolve persistent technical challenges, such as login functionality. Regularly review progress to ensure timely resolution.
