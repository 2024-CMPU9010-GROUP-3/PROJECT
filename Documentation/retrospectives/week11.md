### **1. Mad**

- Overall, the team feels no frustration this week, however one concern was raised about uneven contributions from some members, who spend more time on other things unrelated to the project, which places more burden on the other team members.

### **2. Sad**

- A few members were disappointed that we couldn’t implement more features based on user feedback before the feature freeze. 
- Team morale seems to be a little down, which should be addressed.

### **3. Glad**

- The positive feedback from user evaluations has been very valuable, encouraging and validating.
- The frontend has improved significantly from it's inital state, looks much better and is more user friendly.
- Thanks to each members contribution, the project has really come together and feels quite polished especially for a university project.
- Overall, the team is maintaining a good pace and on track for the final submission.
