### **1. Mad**

- **Prototype not good enough**: A team member has expressed their frustration with the development of the front-end prototypes, especially in adding the new features and improving usability and user-friendliness. They hope to discuss it in a group and reach a consensus on the way forward because it involves both front-end and back-end.
- **Slow Frontend Progress**: Another team member has expressed their frustration with the slow pace of the frontend development.

### **2. Sad**

- **Unit Testing Challenges**: A team member has been stuck on this task for over a week, which is bringing their morale down. They are hoping to finally get it sorted this week and we're wishing them a lot of luck to do so. 
- **Mid Feedback**: Another team member found that this week, we got less positive feedback than previous weeks; questioning the core use of our project which is daunting to hear in week 7.
- **Empty parking Detection Challenges**: A team member has been struggling with this task because of the challenges of drawing the bounding boxes at the right scale for those spaces and obtaining the coordinates.


### **3. Glad**

- **Good projected timeline**: The path the project has taken with the new feature implementation and new ideas for the web application are exciting and we are on a good path to implementing them and producing a good product with positive feedback from the mentors.
- **Quick new feature implementation**: Progress with implementing new amenities has been quicker than anticipated which is significant.
- **Positive group dynamic**: The team is running smoothly with good synergy, good communication and great discussions.
- **Significant responses on Survey**: We've received over a 100 responses on the initial market survey which has been surprising and very insightful. The participants range in many different sectors and their responses have helped us define the additional features to implement.
- **New learns**: A team member has expressed their content over successfully learning a new language feature to help with their tasks on the frontend and solved an issue that has been on their plate for a while.
