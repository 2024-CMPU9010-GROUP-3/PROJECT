### **1. Mad**

- Some frontend items are taking longer than intially planned, causing delays and stress

### **2. Sad**

- Labelling tasks for the evaluation of the empty parking spot detection took longer than anticipated
- Team pace seems to be slowing down and excitement for the project seems to have weakened
- Some features we planned for may not be implemented in time before the major feature freeze
- Getting professional users who we are targeting for usability testing is tough
- Some members feel as though they don't get to do enough developping/coding tasks

### **3. Glad**

- We are on track for submissions and our milestones
- Backend feature implemented relatively quickly
- Current bugs are non-critical and won't harm the final result
- Getting valuable user feedback from the user evaluations and the final product looks better than before

### **Action Items:**

- Enhance Presentation Dynamics:
  Encourage equitable participation during presentations. Allocate roles in advance to ensure balanced contribution and professionalism when responding to feedback.

  Implement a more rigorous code review system to catch potential reintroductions of resolved issues and improve overall code quality.

- Prioritize Tool Training:
  Schedule dedicated training sessions for key tools (e.g., LaTeX, xywhr) early in the project timeline to ensure efficiency and maintain quality standards.

- Address Frontend Criticisms:
  Act on specific feedback regarding the frontend and explore ways to demonstrate the app’s utility more effectively during evaluations.

- Resolve Login and Other Critical Issues:
  Allocate resources and establish a timeline to address and resolve persistent technical challenges, such as login functionality. Regularly review progress to ensure timely resolution.
