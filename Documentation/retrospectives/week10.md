### **1. Mad**

- Some frontend items are taking longer than intially planned, causing delays and stress

### **2. Sad**

- Labelling tasks for the evaluation of the empty parking spot detection took longer than anticipated
- Team pace seems to be slowing down and excitement for the project seems to have weakened
- Some features we planned for may not be implemented in time before the major feature freeze
- Getting professional users who we are targeting for usability testing is tough
- Some members feel as though they don't get to do enough developping/coding tasks

### **3. Glad**

- We are on track for submissions and our milestones
- Backend feature implemented relatively quickly
- Current bugs are non-critical and won't harm the final result
- Getting valuable user feedback from the user evaluations and the final product looks better than before

---

### **Action Items:**

- Build on feedback from user evaluation:
  Work on items raised during user evaluation and implement major new features before code freeze

- Start the final report:
  As coding tasks wind down, it is important to start the final report early to give time to all members to write in a lot of details the areas they worked on during this project.

- Keep up momentum!! We're almost there guys :)'
