Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this email reaches you well.
My name is Anais Blenet, I am a computer science student at the Technological University of Dublin. With 5 other students, we are currently working on our master's project, which involves developing a web application that provides information on public amenities. As part of our research, we are conducting a brief survey to gather feedback on how useful this app could be for professional and/or personal use.
Your input would be incredibly valuable, and we'd greatly appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to complete the survey. Hereâ€™s the link: Amenities Access Survey
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate. Thank you in advance for your time and support!
Best regards,
Anais Blenet from Msc in Computer Science - Group 3
