# Summarized feedback from testing sessions

## Best thing about Magpie:
* Map display and amenities excellent
* Everything is great, really useful and brilliant idea of project
* Does exactly what it says (described)
* Has potential for user by certain types of users but needs more functionality
* Presentation of information is very easy to understand

## Worst thing about Magpie:
* Make it more intuitive for users to filter amenities (improve onboarding)
* Some steps of tutorial could be in steps/topics to facilitate reading for those with dyslexia
* Loading times (map) - 3 users
* Missing a search bar to look for a specifc location (4 users)
* Unclear that you are supposed to click on the maps to see the icons appear

## Changes to login/sign up:

* Implement account verification

## Changes to dashboard:
* Make the choice of amenities more intuitive
* Profile menu has mac icons (remove or change)

## Overall impression of Magpie:

* Interesting, unique, useful, practical, handy, convenient, amazing
* Very helpful app, incredibly easy to use, simple & effective
* Very good, very interesting to gather all this information in one place 

## Additional comments:
* Wish there was a little more to the map- more information about the amenities, bus stops, etc.
* Ok-ish, more data could be added
* Add bus/tram stops and taxi ranks
* Missing zoom in and out buttons
* Better wording for the onboarding
* Add extra amenitites like hospitals, garda/fire stations, water/eletrical grid, sewage system, etc.
* (my own comments) Add map color legend?
* Add zoning information on parking amenity
* Add density meter or report generation to show a nice visual breakdown of amenities in the specific search radius

## Main behaviour notes:
* Tries to click on the elements during onboarding (6 users)
* Tries to click on the icons (2 user)
* Tries to interact with dashboard before placing marker on the map due to seeing her own location marker (1 user)
