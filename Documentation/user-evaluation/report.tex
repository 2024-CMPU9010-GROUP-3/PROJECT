\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Proposed Hypothesis}
Our project goal is to develop an app to provide “services at a glance” in Dublin county. In our research, we couldn’t find a singular system that allows users to gain a general overview of public amenities, for example, parking, bike infrastructure, or public transport. In Ireland and the United Kingdom, the prevalence of proper digitised records in county administrations varies wildly (Lynn et al., 2023). Some make use of state-of-the-art geographical information systems (GIS) while others rely on spreadsheets which are manually kept up to date. (McGuirk and MacLaran, 2001) A system that would allow users to quickly inspect a combined dataset grounded in automatically generated, real-world data could accelerate processes like planning permissions, urban development, or resource allocation.\\
Prior to user evaluation, exploratory work was conducted in the forms of a market research survey to answer key demographic \& product questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Who is our primary target user?
    \item What kind of amenity data do they access and how?
    \item What devices/tools do they primarily use?
    \item Are they satisfied with those tools?
    \item Would they consider Magpie useful in filling the gaps in their toolset?
\end{itemize}
Responses from the survey further cemented our user personas created beforehand, and helped implement additional features prior to the user evaluation.
User persona – urban planner (include sector charts, device chart, tool satisfaction chart, magpie usefulness chart)
