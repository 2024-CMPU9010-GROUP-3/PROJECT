    \\Civil servants will use the app  for urban planning purposes such as in the following use cases:
    \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
            \item to ensure parking spaces adhere to local zoning regulations
            \item to assess the demand/supply for parking in various areas of a city
            \item to oversee existing parking amenities, conditions and pricing
            \item to consider environmental and traffic impact when planning to build new spaces
        \end{itemize}
    \\Private individuals will use the app in the following use cases:
    \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
            \item to view real-time parking availability given their current location or a specified destination within a defined radius
            \item to see the cost of available parking spots nearby allowing them to compare and choose the best option
            \item to view available parking based on special filters, such as handicap-accessible parking, electric vehicle charging stations, etc...
