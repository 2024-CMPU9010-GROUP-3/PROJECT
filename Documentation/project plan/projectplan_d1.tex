    We are using Github and their built-in project management tool. We are also adopting an Agile approach where we'll be working on completing milestones every week.\\ \\
    Deadlines will include project initialization, first mock-up, dataset creation, model development and training, testing phase and final submission. \\ \\
    Success in this project is good teamwork all throughout and delivering a good quality working product we are all satisfied with.

    We have decided to meet everyday online at 12pm, to check in for the day, discuss previous day and current day tasks. \\ These online meetings last around 30 minutes and everyone is usually in attendance except of Kaustubh who works night shifts. Saul keeps minutes of each meetings and updates Kaustubh subsequently. \\ \\ We have also decided to meet in person on Fridays after the presentation. \\ \\ Decision-making so far is unanimous, we'll see how that progresses. Turn-taking we still need to discuss as each member has their own expertise. \vspace{0.3cm}} \\
