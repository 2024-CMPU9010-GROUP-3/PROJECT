        \textbf{Project Summary:} & \parbox{0.65\textwidth}{\vspace{0.3cm} \textbf{What are you doing?} \vspace{0.3cm}\\ The aim of this project is to create a Single Page Application (SPA) to aid urban design decisions by providing detailed insight into available amenities which include and are not limited to parking spaces both street-level and underground, bike sheds, accessible ramps, bike lanes, etc.\\ The SPA will integrate computer vision with publicly available mapping datasets.\\
        \vspace{0.3cm} \textbf{Why are you doing it?} \vspace{0.3cm}\\ To help enhance the efficiency of urban planning for public authorities by providing detailed insight into available amenities.\\
        \vspace{0.3cm} \textbf{Who will use it? And how will they use it?} \vspace{0.3cm}\\ The main users of our application are civil servants and private individuals. \textbf{Note, this is not a complete list and only an example.}\\ \\
        Civil servants will use the app for urban planning purposes such as in the following use cases:
        \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
            \item To ensure parking spaces adhere to local zoning regulations
            \item To assess the demand/supply for parking in various areas of a city
            \item To oversee existing parking amenities, conditions, and pricing
            \item To consider environmental and traffic impact when planning to build new spaces
        \end{itemize}
        \vspace{0.3cm}
        Private individuals will use the app in the following use cases:
        \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
            \item To view real-time parking availability given their current location or a specified destination within a defined radius
            \item To see the cost of available parking spots nearby, allowing them to compare and choose the best option
            \item To view available parking based on special filters, such as handicap-accessible parking, electric vehicle charging stations, etc.
