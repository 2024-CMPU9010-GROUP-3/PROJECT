# YOLOv8 research papers notes

## An improved ire detection approach based on YOLOv8 for smart cities (2023)
*Yolo is popular because of its high accuracy & small model size
*Yolov8 is anchor-free which means it estimates the center of the object explicitely instead of predicting an item's distance from a known anchor-box.
-->Anchor free detection lowers the number of box prédictions which expedites NMS
--> NMS (non-maximum suppression) is a pre-processing technique used in computer vision tasks to eliminate redundant bounding boxes, refining model prédictions especially in object detection tasks.
*their model was configured as follows
epochs: 300	|batch size: 16		|parameters: 11,136,374
lr: 0.01	|n° imgs: 26,520	|train/test split: 80-20
img size: 512	|layers: 225
*results as follows
fire precision: 95.7%
smoke precision: 99.3%
mAP: 97.5%
*my conclusion: I might need more images for training
