# YOLOv8 research papers notes

## Paper 1: An improved ire detection approach based on YOLOv8 for smart cities (2023)
*Yolo is popular because of its high accuracy & small model size
*Yolov8 is anchor-free which means it estimates the center of the object explicitely instead of predicting an item's distance from a known anchor-box.
-->Anchor free detection lowers the number of box prédictions which expedites NMS
--> NMS (non-maximum suppression) is a pre-processing technique used in computer vision tasks to eliminate redundant bounding boxes, refining model prédictions especially in object detection tasks.
*their model was configured as follows
epochs: 300	|batch size: 16		|parameters: 11,136,374
lr: 0.01	|n° imgs: 26,520	|train/test split: 80-20
img size: 512	|layers: 225
*results as follows
fire precision: 95.7%
smoke precision: 99.3%
mAP: 97.5%
*my conclusion: I might need more images for training

## Paper 2: Colorectal polyp detection in colonoscopy image using YOLOv8 network (2023)
*They chose Yolov8 "m" model
*They achieved Following results:
precision: 95.6%
recall: 91.7%
F1-score: 92.4%
*Used 1,890 images in total from 5 publicly available datasets, split into train 80 - val 10 - test 10
*Trained all five YOLOv8 models
*No mention of the exact parameters for the training
*my conclusion: try to increase the percentage of training maybe? right now i'm at 80-20, try 90-10, or decrease even to 70-30
